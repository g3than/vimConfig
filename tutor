Hello world
This is ther first vim file i have ever written
I hope we will have a good time together

Here are some commands to remeber:
	Append at end of line:	:A
	Remove word		:rm
	End of line		:$
	Start nex word		:w
	End current word	:e
	Start of line		:0
	Delete line		:dd
	Del and Insert		:c
	Top of file		:gg
	Bottom of file		:G
	Move to line:		:[line] G
	Append line below	:o
	Append line above	:O

So far so good. I managed to remember most of these shortcuts and installed some plugins.
Here are some old and new commands to remeber:
	Mark whole line:	V
	Remove word	:		rm
	Del and Insert:		c
